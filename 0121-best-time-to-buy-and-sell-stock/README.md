<h2>My Approach to solve</h2>
1. First we took the first element of the vector as min value cause we want to subtract min from max.
2. Then initially took the 0 as max value.
3. Iterating through the vector elements, if the next value is lower we take that as min and then in next iteration look for 
   against that value.
4. If the next value is larger then subtract the min from the current and update the max with the result.

<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/">121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3><hr><div><p>You are given an array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.</p>

<p>You want to maximize your profit by choosing a <strong>single day</strong> to buy one stock and choosing a <strong>different day in the future</strong> to sell that stock.</p>

<p>Return <em>the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction</em>. If you cannot achieve any profit, return <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
