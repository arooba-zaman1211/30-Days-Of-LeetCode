â€‹Using a vector in this context allows for flexibility in handling collections of integers. vector is a dynamic array-like data structure in C++ that can resize itself dynamically, making it suitable for scenarios where the number of elements is not known beforehand or may change during runtime.

This Bitwise XOR is used for the purpose of seperating the repeating and the non-repeating numbers as the repeating values return 0 and 1 otherwise. The value that returns 1 is stored here in result variable.
